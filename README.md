# song_api
I wrote a simple API where you can add a song, this song contains the name of the song and the artist. I personally like to listen to music throughout the day so I thought it would be fun to add some of my favourite songs to this API.

# What does this API do?
You can add a song with a post request. You have two get requests to view all the songs and just one single song. Then you have a put request to change the artist or name of a song and then you have a delete request to delete a song.
